# Results Structure

Inside the structure, there are 4 sub-sections as follows:

  - FDATA: All the data gattered from the simulations and the parameters used in the simulations;
  - ReferenceModel: Mass and Friction of the reference model used in the simulations;
  - Simulations: Table with the multipliers of the impedance model in relation to the reference model.
      Each rows represents a different case, where columns is the mass and frictions multipliers.
